| Usage             | Theoretical model          | Practical & widely used     |

---

### **4. What are the layers in the TCP/IP model?**

Yes sir, the TCP/IP model has **4 layers**:

1. **Application Layer**  
2. **Transport Layer**  
3. **Internet Layer**  
4. **Network Access Layer (or Link Layer)**

---

### **5. What is the role of the Transport layer?**

Sir, the Transport layer ensures **end-to-end communication**, reliability, and flow control.  
It breaks data into segments and manages error detection and recovery using **TCP or UDP protocols**.

---

### **6. Which layer does HTTP operate on?**

HTTP operates at the **Application Layer** of both the **OSI** and **TCP/IP** models.  
Itâ€™s responsible for handling **web-based communication** like browsing websites.

---

### **7. Which OSI layer is responsible for routing?**

**The Network Layer** is responsible for **routing**, meaning it decides the best path for data to travel across networks using **IP addresses**.

---

### **8. What is encapsulation in networking?**

Encapsulation is the process of **adding headers/trailers** around data as it moves down the OSI layers.  
Think of it like **putting a letter in an envelope, then a box, then labeling it for delivery**.

---

### **9. What is the difference between logical and physical addressing?**

- **Logical Addressing** refers to **IP addresses** (used at the Network layer).
- **Physical Addressing** refers to **MAC addresses** (used at the Data Link layer).  

Logical addresses can **change**, but physical addresses are **fixed** to the hardware.

---

### **10. What is the use of the session layer?**

For example, it allows me to **stay logged in** to a video call or game without interruption.

---

# ðŸ”¹ IP Addressing & Subnetting (11â€“20)

---

### **11. What is an IP address?**

**Yes sir.**  
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.  
It acts like a **home address for your device**, helping data reach the correct destination.

---

### **12. What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?**

**Sure sir. Here's the difference:**

- **IPv4**: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.0.1), supports about **4.3 billion devices**.
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8::1), supports **trillions of devices**.  
Also, IPv6 offers better **security and efficiency**.

---

### **13. What is a private IP address?**

**Yes sir.**  
A private IP address is used **within a local network** (like in homes or offices).  
Itâ€™s **not accessible** from the internet directly. Example: `192.168.x.x`.

---

### **14. What is a public IP address?**

A public IP address is assigned by **ISPs** and is used to **identify your device on the internet**.  
It allows communication **outside your network**, unlike private IPs.

---

### **15. What is the difference between static and dynamic IP addresses?**

**Sir, hereâ€™s the key difference:**

- **Static IP**: Manually assigned, doesn't change (used for servers).
- **Dynamic IP**: Automatically assigned by DHCP, changes over time (used by most users).

---

### **16. What is subnetting?**

**Yes sir.**  
Subnetting is the process of **dividing a large network into smaller, manageable sub-networks (subnets)**.  
It improves **performance, security, and IP address utilization**.

---

### **17. What is a subnet mask?**

A subnet mask defines **which portion of the IP is the network part and which is the host part**.  
Example:  
For IP `192.168.1.1` with mask `255.255.255.0`, the `192.168.1` is network, `1` is host.

---

### **18. What is CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)?**

CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses **without relying on classes (A, B, C)**.  
It uses a **slash notation**, like `192.168.1.0/24`, to define subnet size.

---

### **19. What is loopback address and its purpose?**

**Yes sir.**  
The loopback address is **127.0.0.1**. Itâ€™s used to **test your deviceâ€™s own network stack**.  
Like pinging yourself to see if networking is working properly.

---

### **20. What are IP address classes (A, B, C, D, E)?**

Sir, hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

- **Class A**: `1.0.0.0 â€“ 126.255.255.255` (Large networks)
- **Class B**: `128.0.0.0 â€“ 191.255.255.255` (Medium networks)
- **Class C**: `192.0.0.0 â€“ 223.255.255.255` (Small networks)
- **Class D**: `224.0.0.0 â€“ 239.255.255.255` (Multicast)
- **Class E**: `240.0.0.0 â€“ 255.255.255.255` (Reserved for experiments)

# ðŸ”¹ Protocols & Port Numbers (21â€“30)

---

### **21. What is the use of TCP and UDP?**

**Yes sir.**  
TCP and UDP are **Transport Layer protocols** used to send data between devices:

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Used when **reliability** is needed, like in web browsing, emails.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Used when **speed** is more important than reliability, like in video streaming or gaming.

---

### **22. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?**

| Feature        | TCP                          | UDP                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Connection     | Connection-oriented           | Connectionless             |
| Reliability    | Reliable, ensures delivery    | Unreliable, no guarantee   |
| Speed          | Slower                        | Faster                     |
| Use Cases      | Web, Email, File Transfer     | Streaming, Gaming, DNS     |
| Header Size    | Larger (more overhead)        | Smaller (lightweight)      |

---

### **23. What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?**

**Yes sir.**  
ARP is used to **map an IP address to a MAC address** in a local network.  
For example, if my device knows someone's IP but not their MAC, ARP finds it so it can send the data.

---

### **24. What is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?**

DHCP is used to **automatically assign IP addresses** to devices in a network.  
Instead of manually setting IPs, a DHCP server gives them out dynamically when devices connect.

---

### **25. What is the purpose of DNS?**

DNS stands for **Domain Name System**.  
It **translates human-readable domain names** (like `google.com`) into **IP addresses** (like `142.250.64.110`) so computers can communicate.

---

### **26. Explain TCP three-way handshake.**

**Yes sir.**  
Itâ€™s the process of **establishing a reliable connection** between a client and a server:

1. **SYN** â€“ Client sends a connection request.
2. **SYN-ACK** â€“ Server acknowledges and replies.
3. **ACK** â€“ Client confirms and connection is established.

---

### **27. What is NAT (Network Address Translation)?**

NAT allows **multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP** for accessing the internet.  
It helps in **IP address conservation** and adds a **security layer** by hiding internal addresses.

---

### **28. What is ICMP and where is it used?**

ICMP stands for **Internet Control Message Protocol**.  
Itâ€™s used for **error reporting and diagnostics**, like with the `ping` command to check if a host is reachable.

---

### **29. What are port numbers?**

Port numbers identify **specific processes/services** on a device.  
They help the system **know where to send incoming data**, like HTTP on port 80 or SSH on port 22.

---

### **30. Name common ports: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, DNS.**

Yes sir, here are the standard port numbers:

- **HTTP** â€“ 80  
- **HTTPS** â€“ 443  
- **FTP** â€“ 21  
- **SSH** â€“ 22  
- **DNS** â€“ 53
